# Changelog

All notable changes to `svg-scroll-draw` are documented here.

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added
- **`Cinematic` class** — the runtime bridge for [Cinematic Studio](https://github.com/DhruvilChauahan0210/reel),
  the visual scroll-animation editor. Reads a `story.json` authored in the Studio and
  wires a scroll-scrubbed timeline with zero JavaScript on the author's side:

  ```js
  import { Cinematic } from "svg-scroll-draw";
  import story from "./story.json";
  new Cinematic({ wrapper: "#app" }).loadStory(story);
  ```
- **`loadStory(story)`** builds a sticky-stage scroll structure from the story, strokes
  each traced `draw` path on across its scroll range, and fades `fade` layers (the product
  photo) in. Honors `prefers-reduced-motion` by jumping to the finished frame, and only
  runs its rAF loop while the stage is on screen (IntersectionObserver-gated).
- **Cinematic Story protocol types** exported: `Story`, `StoryScene`, `StoryAnimation`,
  `DrawAnimation`, `FadeAnimation`, `StoryEasing`. New `svg-scroll-draw/cinematic` subpath
  for tree-shaken imports.
- **5 new tests** covering DOM construction, draw + fade scrubbing at a known scroll
  position, reduced-motion fallback, and observer lifecycle. **254 tests total.**

### Notes
- Fully backward compatible — purely additive. The existing `scrollDraw` API is untouched.

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **`autoplay` option** (`boolean`, default `false`) — trigger the animation when the
  element enters the viewport instead of tying it to scroll position. The draw runs over
  `duration` milliseconds and replays each time the element re-enters the viewport. Use
  `once: true` to play only the first time.
- **`duration` option** (`number`, default `1000`) — animation duration in milliseconds,
  used only when `autoplay: true`.
- All existing visual options work in autoplay mode: `easing`, `stagger`, `fade`,
  `strokeColor`, `strokeWidth`, `fillOpacity`, `clip`, `morphTo`, `waypoints`, `repeat`,
  `repeatDelay`, `onStart`, `onComplete`, `onProgress`, `direction`.
- The full instance API works in autoplay mode — `pause` / `resume` freeze/unfreeze
  elapsed time; `seek(0–1)` jumps to a fraction of `duration`; `replay` restarts from 0.
- **8 new tests** covering autoplay draw, `onStart`, `onComplete`, `seek`, `replay`,
  `destroy`, clip mode, and `once`. **249 tests total.**

### Notes
- Fully backward compatible — `autoplay` defaults to `false`, existing scroll-driven
  code is unchanged.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **Native CSS scroll-driven rendering** — when the browser supports
  [`animation-timeline: view()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline)
  and the config is simple (default trigger, named easing, optional `fade`, forward or
  reverse), the draw now runs on the compositor with **zero per-frame JavaScript and no
  scroll/resize listeners**. The full instance API (`pause`, `resume`, `seek`, `replay`,
  `getProgress`, `destroy`) works on both the native and JS paths.
- **`native` option** (`boolean`, default `true`) — set `false` to always use the JS
  engine. When `true`, the JS engine is still used automatically for any config CSS
  can't express declaratively (callbacks, `stagger`, `morphTo`, `velocityScale`,
  `autoReverse`, `once`, `repeat`, custom trigger/scroll-container, `speed ≠ 1`,
  custom-function or `spring` easing, animated color/width/fill).
- **27 new tests** (`engine-native.test.ts`) covering native activation, automatic
  fallback for every non-eligible config, the unsupported-browser path, and the
  instance API on the native path. **221 tests total.**

### Changed
- Documentation now reports the accurate **~4.4 KB gzipped** core size (the engine has
  grown well beyond the original ~3 KB with morph, clip, velocity, waypoints, timeline,
  and group features). Still 8–9× smaller than Framer Motion or GSAP DrawSVG.

### Notes
- Fully backward compatible — existing code keeps working unchanged, and behavior is
  identical in browsers without native `animation-timeline` support.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-28

First stable release. The public API is now considered stable — no breaking changes
will be made without a major version bump.

### Added
- **`scrollDrawSequence` bug fix** — engines are now all created upfront and paused;
  later steps no longer read the wrong scroll position when chained. `activeIdx`
  now tracks correctly so `pause()`, `resume()`, `seek()`, and `getProgress()`
  always target the currently active step.
- **194 passing tests** across 6 test suites — engine, engine-options, group,
  timeline, framework wrappers (Angular, Astro, Svelte, Solid), and utilities.
- **Framework wrapper tests** — Angular `ScrollDrawRef`, Astro `initScrollDraw`,
  Svelte `scrollDraw` action + `createScrollDraw`, Solid `useScrollDraw` +
  `createScrollDraw` all now have dedicated test coverage.
- **Root workspace test runner** — `npx vitest run` from the repo root now works
  correctly via `vitest.workspace.ts`, picking up all packages with the right jsdom
  environment.

### Improved
- **Coverage** — lines 94.98%, functions 95.23%, branches 82.94%; all thresholds pass.
- **JSDoc** — `clip`, `morphTo`, and `scrollDrawSequence` now document their
  non-obvious edge cases inline (clip:true maps to 'left', morphTo silently no-ops
  on non-path elements, sequence forces once:true per step).

## [0.6.2] — 2026

### Added
- **`fillOpacity`** — animate fill opacity in sync with the stroke draw. Single number = static override; `[from, to]` tuple = interpolate as the path draws. Use `fillOpacity={[0, 1]}` to flood a shape's fill in as its outline traces itself — no `onComplete` hack needed.
- **`useScrollDrawProgress` hook (React)** — returns a reactive `number` (0–1) representing scroll progress for any element. Same `trigger` / `speed` / `easing` / `axis` / `scrollContainer` / `once` options as `ScrollDraw`. Use it to drive any animation alongside or independent of an SVG draw.
- **`svg-scroll-draw/web-component`** export — `<scroll-draw>` custom element now importable directly; previously only available via CDN.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2025

### Added
- **Pause / Resume / Seek** — imperative API to programmatically control animation state
- **Path Morphing** (`morphTo`) — interpolate a path's `d` attribute from its original shape to a target shape as you scroll
- **Velocity Scale** (`velocityScale`) — draw speed scales with how fast the user scrolls
- **Repeat** (`repeat`, `repeatDelay`) — replay the animation N times or loop it infinitely
- **Astro adapter** (`svg-scroll-draw/astro`) — data-attribute API with `initScrollDraw()`, no JS imports in markup
- **Nuxt adapter** (`svg-scroll-draw/nuxt`) — `useScrollDraw()` composable for Nuxt 3
- **Group API** (`svg-scroll-draw/group`) — `scrollDrawGroup` and `scrollDrawSequence` for animating multiple SVG containers simultaneously or in sequence
- **Web Component** (`svg-scroll-draw/web-component`) — `<scroll-draw>` custom element, auto-registers via CDN or import

---

## [0.5.0]

### Added
- Internal refactor preparing adapters for Astro, Nuxt, and Group API

---

## [0.4.0]

### Added
- **SolidJS adapter** (`svg-scroll-draw/solid`) — `useScrollDraw` hook
- **Angular adapter** (`svg-scroll-draw/angular`) — `ScrollDrawRef` class for `AfterViewInit` pattern
- **Color animation** (`strokeColor`) — static override or `[from, to]` tuple to animate stroke color as the path draws
- **Width animation** (`strokeWidth`) — static override or `[from, to]` tuple to animate stroke width as the path draws
- **Auto Reverse** (`autoReverse`) — animation follows scroll direction, reversing when the user scrolls back up
- **Custom scroll container** (`scrollContainer`) — target a specific scrollable element instead of the window
- **Waypoints** — fire callbacks at specific scroll progress thresholds (0–1)
- **Delay** (`delay`) — milliseconds to wait before the engine starts observing

---

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- **Svelte adapter** (`svg-scroll-draw/svelte`) — `use:scrollDraw` action
- **Horizontal scroll** (`axis: "x"`) — track horizontal scroll containers

- **Spring easing** — physics-based overshoot-and-settle curve
- **Once mode** (`once`) — draw once and stay drawn
- **Debug overlay** (`debug`) — visualizes trigger start/end zones in development
- **`onStart` lifecycle hook** — fires on the first animation frame

---

## [0.2.1]

### Fixed
